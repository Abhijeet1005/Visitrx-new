-- Assignments -- 
+ ❌ add a new controller which will be called by department admins to enter and remove the names of employee to which asset is assigned
+ ❌ this will add new fields to the assignment database named "employee" and "isAssigned" boolean 
+ ✅ modify department middleware to use .include("Head") 
+ ✅modify assignment fetch for department(along with using "Head" instead of "Admin")

-- Employees(not Users) --
